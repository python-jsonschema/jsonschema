``jsonschema`` is an implementation of `JSON Schema <http://json-schema.org>`_
for Python (supporting 2.7+ including Python 3).

.. code-block:: python

    >>> from jsonschema import validate

    >>> # A sample schema, like what we'd get from json.load()
    >>> schema = {
    ...     "type" : "object",
    ...     "properties" : {
    ...         "price" : {"type" : "number"},
    ...         "name" : {"type" : "string"},
    ...     },
    ... }

    >>> # If no exception is raised by validate(), the instance is valid.
    >>> validate({"name" : "Eggs", "price" : 34.99}, schema)
    {'name': 'Eggs', 'price': 34.99}

    >>> validate(
    ...     {"name" : "Eggs", "price" : "Invalid"}, schema
    ... )                                   # doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ValidationError: 'Invalid' is not of type 'number'

It can also be used from console:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ jsonschema -i sample.json sample.schema

Features
--------

* Full support for
  `Draft 6 <https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validate/#jsonschema.Draft6Validator>`_,
  `Draft 4 <https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validate/#jsonschema.Draft4Validator>`_
  and
  `Draft 3 <https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validate/#jsonschema.Draft3Validator>`_

* `Lazy validation <https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/validate/#jsonschema.IValidator.iter_errors>`_
  that can iteratively report *all* validation errors.

* Small and extensible

* `Programmatic querying <https://python-jsonschema.readthedocs.io/en/latest/errors/#module-jsonschema>`_
  of which properties or items failed validation.


Release Notes
-------------

Version 2.6.0 drops support for Python 2.6.X (ha ha) and contains a
number of small improvements in error messages, as well as a bug fix for
``ErrorTree``.


Running the Test Suite
----------------------

If you have ``tox`` installed (perhaps via ``pip install tox`` or your
package manager), running ``tox`` in the directory of your source
checkout will run ``jsonschema``'s test suite on all of the versions
of Python ``jsonschema`` supports. If you don't have all of the
versions that ``jsonschema`` is tested under, you'll likely want to run
using``tox``'s ``--skip-missing-interpreters`` option.

Of course you're also free to just run the tests on a single version with your
favorite test runner. The tests live in the ``jsonschema.tests`` package.


Benchmarks
----------

``jsonschema``'s benchmarks make use of `perf <https://perf.readthedocs.io>`_.

Running them can be done via ``tox -e perf``, or by invoking the ``perf``
commands externally (after ensuring that both it and ``jsonschema`` itself are
installed)::

    $ python -m perf jsonschema/benchmarks/test_suite.py --hist --output results.json

To compare to a previous run, use::

    $ python -m perf compare_to --table reference.json results.json

See the ``perf`` documentation for more details.


Community
---------

There's a `mailing list <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jsonschema>`_
for this implementation on Google Groups.
